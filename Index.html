	<h1 style="text-align:center;">Tips for Football</h1>
	<div class="paragraph">
	<p>Here are a few tips to help you make better at football</p>
	<h2>Soccer shooting tips:</h2>

	<p>Observe the goalkeeper's position. Have they left a gap that you can exploit?</p>
	<p>Select the best technique for your shot. A sidefoot shot will have greater accuracy,<br> but an instep (laces) with good follow-through will have greater power.</p>
	<p>Put your non-kicking foot alongside the ball.</p>
	<p>Keep your head down and your eyes on the ball when striking.</p>
	<p>Keep your body over the ball.</p>
	<p>Make contact with the middle to top half of the ball.</p>
	<p>Maintain your composure.</p>

	<h2>Tips to improve your chance of scoring:</h2>
	<p>Shoot wide rather than high. There's a better chance of getting a deflection that will<br> wrong-foot the goalkeeper.</p>
	<p>Shoot low. It's harder for a keeper to reach shots along the ground because it's<br> further for them to travel. It's easy for them to jump up and save, but much harder to<br> crouch down and get it.</p>
	<p>Shoot across the keeper. It's tougher for them to hold these shots, and means they could divert the ball back into the path of another attacker.</p>

	<h2>Where Are the Most Shots Made?
</h2>
<p>Ever wondered if there's actually a "sweet spot" in a soccer goal? A place where you could kick the ball and it would go in almost every time?</p>
<p>Well, there may not be a definitive "sweet spot," but a recent study did take a look at where scored goals most often went into the net. Here are the results:</p>
<table style="margin-left: 10%;">
	<tr>
		<td><b>Top Left:</b> 8 percent</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Top Center:</b> 4 percent</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<b>Top Right:</b> 5 percent
	</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>Ouch. As you can see, shooting high means you have a pretty low percentage of actually scoring.

</p>
<table style="margin-left:10%;">
	<tr><td><b>Middle Left:</b> 7 percent</td></tr>
	<tr><td><b>Middle Center:</b>8 percent</td></tr>
	<tr><td><b>Middle Right:</b>6 percent</td></tr>
</table>

<p>While you have a better chance of scoring if you shoot to the middle than up high, the odds still aren't much in your favor.</p>
<table style="margin-left:10%;">
	<tr><td><b>Bottom Left:</b>22 percent</td></tr>
	<tr><td><b>Bottom Center: </b>21 percent</td></tr>
	<tr><td><b>Bottom Right:</b>19 percent</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Look at these stats: 62 percent of all goals were scored low. This makes sense because it <br>is very difficult for goalkeepers, especially tall ones, to get down to the ground. It's much<br> easier and more natural for them to jump high.</p>

<p>Also, looking at the statistics, 67 percent of goals were scored in the corners versus 33 <br>percent down the middle. If you combine the two statistics and shoot low into the corner,<br> you should have a much greater success rate in scoring goals.</p>

<p>As with any soccer technique, you need to practice if you want to improve your shooting <br>skills. Fortunately, the techniques used for shooting are similar to those used for passing.<br> So you can build up two vital soccer techniques at the same time.</p>

<p>But most importantly: If you see the goal, shoot!</p>

<p>This one piece of advice is important enough to reiterate: You miss 100 percent of the<br> shots you never take. If you see an opportunity to shoot, take it! The only way these tips <br>can help you is if you implement them, both in practice and in games.</p>
